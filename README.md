# Simple RPG Engine in Python
An engine for simple RPGs, using appJar for GUI and YAML for data.
**NB! THIS ENGINE IS STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

## Why?
I'm trying to make this a game engine which is as easy to use as possible, requiring minimal programming skills.
That's why I'm using appJar, because it is incredibly easy to use and YAML, because that's one of the most human-readable data serialization languages. 
But if you already know a bit about programming, feel free to use the code in this for your own projects!

## NOTES:
### What needs to be done?
* Pull over all the data from the failed repositories.
* Start properly commenting and versioning the code.
* Continue writing the engine.
