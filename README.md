# Simple RPG Engine in Python
An engine for simple RPGs, using appJar for GUI and YAML for data.
**NB! THIS ENGINE IS STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

## Why?
I'm trying to make this a game engine which is as easy to use as possible, requiring minimal programming skills to create games.
That's why I'm using appJar, because it is incredibly easy to use and
YAML, because it's one of the most human-readable data serialization languages. 
But if you already know a bit about programming, feel free to modify/copy the code for your own projects!
