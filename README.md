# Simple RPG Engine in Python V0.1 (Game Branch)
This is a seperate branch from the game engine, used to make a game for a school project.

The main engine project will not be worked on until this is done.

**Warning! This version of the game engine may contain game-specific code. It is not intended to be used with anything but the game config files specific to this branch.**
